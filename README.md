## ðŸ”’ Not Meant for Reuse
This isnâ€™t a generic theme or reusable portfolio template. Code is tailored for me, by me. Feel free to poke around if youâ€™re curious, but itâ€™s probably not plug-and-play for anyone else. 

## ðŸ“œ License
MIT, mostly out of habit. But again, this repo isn't built with reusability in mind.
