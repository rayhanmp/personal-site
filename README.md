# Personal Site

This repository contains the static files for my personal website. Content can be managed using [Keystatic](https://keystatic.dev).

## Local development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Keystatic CMS:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The CMS will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Content lives in the `content/` directory and is defined in `keystatic.config.ts`.
